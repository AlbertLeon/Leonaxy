        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Albert Leon, I work full time as a School Technology Technician and enjoy learning and coding part time. How did I learn to code? The year was 2017, I was a College student with still no idea what I want to be when I grow up. I took so many
            college classes and changed majors many times because I was undecided. One day, I looked into my college's catalog and seen web design classes. I signed up with no clue what to expect and with zero knowledge of coding web pages. I enjoyed
            it! Felt like I was a mad scientist making a robot, it was cool! Will be honest, it can be stressful and time consuming. I had many long nights. Fixing coding errors is a headache. On the side of headaches and stresses of learning and fixing
            codes, I enjoyed the web design classes. Web design is definitely an art! For my finals, my instructor had us build a web site with links to other pages, I can proudly say for a first time learner, my website came out top 2 in the class. My
            website was about a movie series, it had movie posters, biography, film locations, it was cool! A year later, I finished the courses and received my certificates for web design and scripting with a 4.0 GPA. After that, I continued college
            and by the year 2020 I had finished college. Ever since 2017 till today, their is not a year where I don't code. After college, I got a job as a Paraeducator for the after school program at a High School. The program needed a website to promote
            the classes and schedule so my bosses looked at me if it is something that I can do? I took the assignment and build my first website for the after school program. It was a happy moment of mine. After 2 years being a Paraeducator, tutoring
            students, helping setting up and fixing technology there, I got hired as a full time School Technology Technician in 2022. Now itâ€™s 2023, I am in the technology field, selling part time web design templates, and already met the love of my
            life who is loved by me very much. Now, I already know what I want to be when I grow up. <br> <br> â€” Albert Leon
